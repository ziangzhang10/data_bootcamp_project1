Project Title: What Determines Traffic Accidents?
Team Members: Erik Dubec, ZiAng Zhang, Yang Yang
Project Description: Determine predictors of traffic
   accidents. We will examine relationships between
   number of traffic accidents and area, month, day, 
   weather conditions, age of driver, gender of driver, etc
Questions to Answer: Do these relationships exist, 
   and if they do do they persist when varied against
   each other.

1) # accidents vs. region
(need # cars by region data)

2) # accidents vs. weather
(no need for other data as # cars and weather are independent)

3) # accidents vs. weather per region
(need weather by region data)

4) # accidents vs. age range
(need car registration by age group data)

5) # accidents vs. time of the day
(no further data needed at this point on pain of being less rigorous)
