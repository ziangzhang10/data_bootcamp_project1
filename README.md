Questions to ask:
1) # accidents vs. region
(need # cars by region data)

2) # accidents vs. weather
(no need for other data as # cars and weather are independent)

3) # accidents vs. weather per region
(need weather by region data)

4) # accidents vs. age range
(need car registration by age group data)

5) # accidents vs. time of the day
(no further data needed at this point on pain of being less rigorous)

# ----------------------------------------------------------
Data needed:
1) Traffic accidents/death data (check)

2) Cars by region (by state)
